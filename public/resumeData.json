    "bio":"Being a massive sports fan, I think of Web Development as an entire sports season: you start your project by taking on a specific part of that project, similar to playing your first game. Eventually, you go through the season facing challenges and successes; one day you set a piece of code together looks marvelous, but then the next day you spend an awfully infuriating amount of time wondering why your code isn't working. However, like any sports team, you practice at your craft; you learn and apply that knowledge going forward. That is the mentality that I have adopted since the first I typed my first piece of code. Always a student of the game.",
